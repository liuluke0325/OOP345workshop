1. Binary file operations 

Binary access will read or write the data without formatting. The benefit of using Binary access is that it will not lose or change any information for the data.

//Write the file in binary mode
ofstream f(file, std::ios::binary);

//open the file to read in binary mode
	f.open(file, ios::binary);

2. Binding a function to its arguments 
The purpose of bind() means to bind one or several arguments to a function object. When we call the function object, the meaning is the same as calling the function with specific arguments. The benefit of using bind function arguments is that it can prevent the code duplication and easier to maintain.
			t[i] = thread(bind(converter, text + i * eachSection, key, (i < num - 1 ? eachSection : nbytes - eachSection * i), Cryptor())); 




3. Multi-threading 
Thread means the sequence of the program(process) which can be executed by scheduler independently. When the operating system executes the multi treads at the same time, it is multi-threading. Because nowadays the hardware usually has multi-core CPU, using multi-threading can reduce the calculation and execution time.

// create multi-threading

for (size_t i = 0; i < num; i++)
		{
			t[i] = thread(converter, text + i * eachSection, key, (i < num - 1 ? eachSection : nbytes - eachSection * i), Cryptor()); // last one length should be total - rest
		}

//join all the treads.
		// join all 
		for (size_t i = 0; i < num; i++)
		{
			t[i].join();
		}
