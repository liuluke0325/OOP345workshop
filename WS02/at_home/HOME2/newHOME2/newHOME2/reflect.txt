1.	the reason for the difference between the copy and move operations 

Because of the different purpose, we have the copy and move operations.
If the source data still exist after being assigned to another object, then we need to use copy operation.
However, if the source data does not exist after being assigned to another object, then we need to use move operation.
As a result, after move constructor(Text d = std::move(a)) and move assignment operator(a = std::move(d)), the original object¡¦s data will be removed.






2.	the dynamic allocation of addresses to objects instead of objects themselves 
The benefit of using dynamic allocation is that the program will require the proper size of memory from the heap at run time.
In the workshop, we need to read the text file first and then store the records into string objects.
However, before we read the file, we have no idea what the size of the record is.
As a result, we cannot directly use static string object array to store the records.
We need to count the record first and then allocate the proper size of memory (this->pstr = new string[numOfString])
This is the reason that we need to use dynamic allocation of addresses to objects.
