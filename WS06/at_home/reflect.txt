1.ƒnThe reason for using the vector container rather than any other available in the STL. 

Vector works as the array, we can easy to add or remove the element at the end of the vector.
In this case, we don¡¦t need to use the iterator to locate different index. As a result, we can simply use the vector to finish the work.
std::vector<iProduct*> products;
this->products.push_back(readRecord(file));

2.Why there is no need to deallocate the dynamically allocated memory in your own code. 
Because the vector will automatically deallocate the memory for us, we don¡¦t need to work on our own.


How the range-based for simplifies coding in this case. 
	for (auto& i : this->products)
		{
			os << *i;
			total += i->price();
		}
3.Range-based is another type of for loop.
Without mentioning the index, it will go through every elements in the array. 
As a result, if we don¡¦t need to work on the index, the range based can shorten our code.
